# Itch.io Embed Game

This project is for embedding an itch.io game.

## Change Log

- Created `index.html` to embed the "STONE" game from itch.io.
- **2023-10-27:**
  - Renamed `index.html.html` to `index.html` for correctness.
  - Investigated an issue where the `iframe` was blocked by `itch.io`.
  - Added `referrerpolicy="no-referrer"` to the `iframe` as a potential fix.
- **2023-10-27 (Update):**
  - Confirmed the "STONE" game does not allow embedding.
  - Switched to "Celeste Classic" as an example game that allows embedding.
